,,Samish Bay,"Samish Bay was where the first Pacific oysters grew in 1919 after being tossed from their cargo ship. It has been chock-full of them ever since. Its shallow, firm-bottomed shores are ideal for beach culture, and that’s what you see in Samish. Numerous oyster growers, including some of the biggest, have farms in Samish Bay. These oysters have rough, lichen-green shells and plump, sweet, mild meats.",,48.5945853,-122.4871505,
,,Hammersley Inlet,"Hammersley Inlet produces big, plump, creamy-white, strong, deeply fluted, and unsubtle. Hammersley Inlet is one of the South Sound inlets known for fat, funky, full-flavored oysters. ""Hammers"" have a strong cucumber finish with a metal chaser.",,47.2069043,-123.0362881,
,,Steamboat Island,"Steamboat Island is a small, supposedly steamboat-shaped knob of hemlock and madrona trees, wild berries and gravelly beaches, rising right where Totten Inlet joins the other fingers of southern Puget Sound. Isolated yet well positioned, it makes extraordinary oyster habitat. It’s a Totten by any other name, deep-cupped and fluted, gray-green, fast-growing, with a mild, earthy flavor and a cucumbery crispness as you chew.",,47.186162,-122.939816,

,,Little Skookum Inlet,"Little Skookum Inlet marks the farthest capillary of Puget Sound. When the tide returns, a carpet of green and brown is lifted off the mudflats and pureed in the currents, creating a thick, funky soup that grows fat, buttery clams and oysters. As you might expect from an inlet so shallow and far from the sea, Little Skookum oysters are not salty.",,47.1384112,-123.0706655,
,,Eld Inlet,"Since the beginning of the oyster industry in Puget Sound, Eld Inlet is recognized for growing the richest oysters. A century ago, bags of oysters from Eld and Totten Inlets commanded two dollars more than bags from neighboring Oakland Bay.

,,Willapa Bay,"Not many oysters from Willapa Bay make it to half-shell service. Few Willapa oysters develop the perfect form that most restaurants seek. The classic Willapa flavor is lightly salty, sweetly cucumber, and delicate,.",,46.5395425,-123.9887775,
,,Netarts Bay,"The gunmetal gray waters of Netarts Bay and Tillamook Bay, in northern Oregon, are alive with charter fishing boats. Netarts Bay oysters are beach-cultured and taste like it: strong, tongue-coating, slightly metallic in flavor. The meats have a softness and a distinctive black line through the mantle.",,45.4028428,-123.9483997,
