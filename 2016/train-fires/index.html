				<p>Federal officials placed the blame for this summer's fiery derailment in Mosier with the railroad, Union Pacific. Soon, many were questioning the railroad's safety practices. Advocates compared the railroad to BSNF, which inspects its track more frequently.</p>

				<p>But safety experts point out the focus should not be on one railroad — the problems with oil trains are systemic to the industry.</p>

				<p>[ QUOTE FROM CHIPKEVIC OR HIS TESTIMONY ]</p>

				<p>According to data compiled by the National Transportation Safety Board, Union Pacific has had fewer incidents than other large railroads. However, BNSF is known to be the biggest hauler of crude by rail, and as such would be expected to have more derailments involving crude.</p>

				</p>The chart below shows that since 2006, trains carrying crude oil or ethanol have derailed on every major railroad — and some small ones.</p>

				<p>The focus, safety experts say, should be on the consequences of these incidents.</p>
				<p>The railroad industry boasts 99 percent of hazardous materials shipments reach their destination safetly. The probability of any one train derailing is low.</p>
				<p>But the potential damage is immense.</p>
				<p>And, as the overall traffic in crude oil rose, so too did the number of spills and fires.</p>
				<p>Since 2006, railroads have spilled unprecedented amounts of hazardous material, from small leaks to large derailments.</p>
