      <p>Not so long ago, a small segregated <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opb.org/artsandlife/series/jazztown/">neighborhood in Portland</a> was home to one of the more fascinating and vibrant jazz scenes on the West Coast. </p>
      <p>The list of names that passed through read like a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opb.org/artsandlife/series/jazztown/photos-jazz-legends-portland-oregon/">hall of fame</a>: Ellington, Basie, Parker, Gillespie, Monk, Coltrane. They all blew the roofs off little clubs in Albina, helping ignite a scene that transformed Portland into a jazz destination. </p>
      <p>The shipyard boom of World War II triggered this music golden age creating new jobs and made Oregon a home for as many as 200,000 newly arrived workers. Tens of thousands of them were black. </p>
      <p>But the city wasn&rsquo;t exactly welcoming.</p>
      <p>Although several hundred African Americans called Oregon home, they hadn&rsquo;t been legally allowed to live here until 1926. During the war, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/08/bank_redlining_creates_bluepri.html">redlining</a> and other forms of institutional discrimination funneled the new African American population into two sections of the city &mdash; Vanport, the nation&rsquo;s largest wartime housing project, and Albina.</p>
      <p>Despite the adversity they faced, Albina became a melting pot of inclusion, a neighborhood with many black-owned businesses that served racially mixed clientele. In this unique neighborhood, progress rested its hat and waited for the world to catch up.</p>
      <p>The neighborhood didn't last, though.</p>

      <h6 class="subheader">An older base map used to illustrate the Memorial Coliseum and South Auditorium areas, 12/31/1950, City of Portland (OR) Archives,  A2011-016</h6>
      <p>Local officials and urban planners declared the community as one of &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honorstheses#page=9&zoom=auto,-74,457">blight</a>.&rdquo; They were looking to acquire real estate for new development and saw Albina as a place where they would face little resistance. Over the next few decades, much of the mostly black population was displaced, leaving an important Oregon tale buried where the Moda Center and Legacy Emanuel Medical Center stand today.</p>
      <p>Oregon Experience&rsquo;s new documentary Jazz Town explores that brief boom in Portland jazz. And in the oral history that follows, residents, musicians and authors talk about the music, the politics, the old neighborhood and its importance. This has been edited for clarity.</p>

      <p>That’s one theory, however it’s unclear exactly why the Dude Ranch closed. It only lasted a year or so, but the club set a standard for Portland. The city’s jazz scene was real — and serious.<p>

      <p class="quote">My dad took him to the train station. About an hour later, there was a knock at the door. It’s Monk and he says, ‘I missed the train.’ It was obvious he just wanted to stay there with my dad … [Eventually], my father called the airlines and told them Monk was an atomic scientist and needed to be at a meeting in Seattle.</p>
      <p class="quote">He took him to the airport and Monk had a suitcase with a belt wrapped around it and a cardboard box and then he had three hats stacked on top of his head...my dad said everybody in the airport stopped and watched him walk across the lobby, this black man with the three hats and a cardboard box and and a suitcase.</p>

      <p>Today, Thelonious Monk is a jazz legend. Back then he was talented pianist who was experimenting with the obscure, intellectual jazz called &ldquo;bebop.&rdquo; One of the most popular styles of jazz in Portland was completely different. It was called &ldquo;jump blues.&rdquo; </p>

        <p>Across the nation, urban renewal projects transformed cities and displaced poorer residents in the 1960s and 1970s. Portland city planners saw the lower Albina district as one in need of revitalization.</p>
        <p>In 1956, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/south_portland_south_auditorium_urban_renewal_project/#.VvR2WCljGQk">voters approved</a> the construction of the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, <a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=honorstheses">clearing 476</a> homes in its path and bulldozing the site of the original jazz club scene. Then came Interstate 5 and Highway 99. By the time the dust settled from the expansion of Emanuel Hospital in 1973, over 200 additional homes and businesses were gone.</p>

          McMillen's Addition in 1938 (left) was a close-knit community and a hot bed of jazz clubs. It was razed in 1958 to make way for the Veterans Memorial Coliseum seen here (right) in 2016.

        <p>“[The project] destroyed the heart of the Black community in Lower Albina,” wrote professor Karen J. Gibson in her article Bleeding Albina: A History of Community Disinvestment, 1940-2000.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:2em;">Over the next 40 years, the lower Albina community saw a drastic demographic shift as black residents were displaced by urban renewal and, later, by rising rents.</p>

        <p>The turbulent 1960s, with national assassinations and unrest at home were no help to the few jazz clubs that remained. <p>

        <p>By the early 70s, there was still jazz in Portland, but there was certainly not much of a jazz scene. <p>

        <p>By then Mel Brown was already on the road. <p>

        <p>The kid who once delivered newspapers around Albina grew up to become a Motown session drummer. He played with Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye, among others. Then he came home and started a new weekly jam session in a room he rented at the Elk’s Lodge.</p>

        <p>The importance of passing his love and knowledge of jazz along was a lesson he learned growing up in the old Albina neighborhood.</p>
